Okay, I need to evaluate the given text to extract a true historical anecdote about Coca-Cola from their 1920 annual report. Let me start by carefully reading through the provided text.

The text begins with permission notices and then presents balance sheets and profit statements. It lists various assets, liabilities, capital accounts, and includes some financial figures like inventories, notes payable, preferred dividends, estimated taxes, prepaid items, fixed assets such as land, buildings, machinery, and intangible assets like formulae, trademarks, trade names, and goodwill.

There's also a section on the profit and loss statement for the year ending December 31, 1920. It mentions profits from operations less other deductions, income taxes, dividends, and how these contribute to net surplus or deficit. The numbers show specific amounts related to income and expenses but don't indicate any significant events.

I'm looking for an anecdote like expansion into a new country, product changes, packaging shifts, leadership changes, etc., as per the rules. However, this text is purely financial with no narrative or event described. It's all about numbers: assets, liabilities, profits, taxes, dividends, and capital accounts.

There's nothing here that tells me about any real historical events, expansions, product changes, legal disputes, leadership shifts, or marketing campaigns. It's strictly a financial report without qualitative information.

So, according to the rules, if there's no clear historical event or anecdote present, I should return just the digit 0.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query where I need to extract a historical anecdote from the provided Coca-Cola annual report text. The user has given specific rules, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.

First, I'll read through the text carefully. It starts with some typos like "MPANY" and mentions the company's officers and directors, including names like W.C. Bradley, Charles H. Candler, etc. There’s a detailed financial section talking about profits, sales, expenses, and plans for expansion, especially in terms of building new plants and foreign policy.

The user wants an anecdote that isn't just a summary of performance or strategy but something specific like expansions, recipe changes, disputes, etc. Looking at the text, there's mention of bottlers being discouraged and a "bottlers' controversy" that lasted 18 months. That seems like a clear event—a dispute between Coca-Cola and their bottlers.

I need to extract one or two sentences about this event. The text says it was settled after 18 months at great expense, leading to harmonious work. So I can craft a sentence around that.

I should avoid discussing profits or sales strategies. Instead, focus on the specific event of the bottler dispute and its resolution. That fits the user's criteria for an anecdote.
</think>

The text mentions a "bottlers' controversy" that lasted 18 months, which was settled at great expense and led to all interests working harmoniously afterward.
: <think>
Okay, so I'm looking at this user query where they want to extract a true historical anecdote from Coca-Cola's annual report. The instructions are pretty clear: no summaries of profits or sales, just specific events. They provided some examples, like introducing a new bottle size or dealing with the Gulf War.

I need to read through the text carefully. Let me start scanning for keywords that might indicate an event. I see mentions of "subsidiaries" and "bottling plants," but those are more about structure than events. Then there's something about The Crystal Carbonic Laboratory moving locations, writing off old plant costs, but still making a profit. That seems like a business decision rather than an event.

Further down, it talks about the Paris bottling plant operating at a loss in its first year but expecting profitability. Again, that's more about financials and operations, not a specific historical anecdote. There are legal sections about trademark decisions and court cases against competitors like Taka-Kola. That could be an event—suing over trademark infringement.

Also, there's mention of the Supreme Court deciding the legality of "Coca-Cola" as a trademark, which is significant. Plus, a district court ruling on soda fountains only being able to serve Coca-Cola products. These legal victories establish their trade rights but don't describe an event like expansion or a campaign.

Looking through more, there's information about taxes on syrup and the impact of the 1921 tax act. That's more policy than an event. The text ends with details about manufacturing plants and capacities, which is operational info.

I think the closest events are the legal decisions regarding trademarks and unfair competition. However, those are more about court cases rather than a clear business action or expansion. The user might be looking for something like entering a new market or a product change, but in this text, I don't see that.

Maybe the establishment of the Paris bottling plant is an event, even though it's in its first year and losing money. But it's not as clear-cut as other examples they gave. Alternatively, the move of Crystal Carbonic might be considered expansion, but again, it's more about restructuring than a new market entry.

I'm leaning towards there not being a specific event mentioned here beyond legal actions, which don't quite fit the examples given. So, the response would likely note that no clear anecdote is found in this text.
</think>

The text provided does not contain any specific historical anecdotes or events related to Coca-Cola's operations, such as product launches, market expansions, or significant business decisions. It primarily focuses on financial summaries, subsidiary information, and operational details like manufacturing and bottling plants.
: <think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract a historical anecdote from the given Coca-Cola annual report text. The user has specified that I should look for specific types of events like expansion into new countries, recipe changes, bottler disputes, wartime production shifts, major ad campaigns, leadership changes with impact, or sourcing/distribution shifts.

First, I'll read through the provided text carefully to identify any such events. Let me go through each section one by one.

Looking at the sections, they start with some addresses and then move into profit and loss statements, auditors' certificates, and balance sheets. These financial parts don't seem to contain the type of anecdotes we're looking for—they’re more about numbers and financial health rather than specific events or changes.

There's a mention of "sugar is the base of Coca-Cola" and that they are the largest consumer of sugar in the world. This could relate to sourcing, but it doesn't specify any changes in sourcing or distribution methods during this period. It’s more of a factual statement about their ingredients.

The text does talk about two periods where sugar usage was restricted: one during the war when sugar was limited to 50% of normal, and another post-war depression. However, these are economic challenges rather than specific events like expansion or changes in manufacturing processes.

I don't see any mention of new countries being entered into, so expansion isn't evident here. There's also no discussion about major advertising campaigns or significant leadership changes, such as new CEOs or strategic hires.

The distribution network is described with numbers like 14 regional factories, 10 divisional warehouses, 1200 bottlers, and 2000 jobbers. While this shows the scale of their operations, it doesn't indicate any shifts or changes in how they distribute products—it's more about capacity.

I was hoping to find something like a recipe change (maybe the transition from cane sugar to corn syrup, though I don't see that here) or a new market entry, but nothing jumps out. The financial details are extensive but not helpful for this purpose.

So, after going through each part, I realize that the text doesn't contain any clear examples of the specific events the user is looking for. It's mostly about financial performance and operational scale without detailing significant historical anecdotes.
</think>

The provided Coca-Cola annual report text does not include specific historical anecdotes such as expansions into new countries, recipe changes, bottler disputes, wartime production shifts, major ad campaigns, leadership changes, or sourcing/distribution shifts. Instead, it focuses on financial data, ingredient sourcing, and operational scale without detailing significant historical events.

**Conclusion:** No specific historical anecdote is present in the text for extraction.
: <think>
Alright, so I'm trying to help extract a historical anecdote from this Coca-Cola annual report text. Let me read through it carefully.

First, I see a lot of financial numbers and line items like Government Securities, Bills Receivable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, and various assets and liabilities. It looks like the usual financial breakdowns: current assets, permanent assets, notes payable, accounts payable, etc. There's also some mention of Deferred Charges and Prepaid Interest.

But wait, at the end of the text, there's a mention of an advertisement in The Saturday Evening Post for four seasons throughout 1922. It says it's typical of the ads that appeared that year. Hmm, this seems relevant because it talks about their advertising strategy during that time.

So, the key point here is Coca-Cola's广告活动在1922年。他们全年推出了四季节的广告，这应该是一个具体的营销举措，属于品牌推广的一部分。不过，根据规则，我需要确保这确实构成一个历史事件或轶事，而不仅仅是战略或市场趋势。

广告通常是企业用来影响消费者行为的重要手段，特别是像 Coca-Cola 这样的大公司。1922年正是美国经济繁荣的时期，广告策略可能对品牌形象和销售有直接影响。这个信息虽然没有具体说明广告的内容或效果，但它确实反映了公司在当年采取的具体行动，所以应该符合要求。

另外，我需要确认是否还有其他地方提到具体的事件，比如产品变化、包装改变或其他历史事件。但整个文本大部分都是财务数据，结尾处的广告部分是唯一提到的具体活动的部分，因此这应该是我要提取的信息。

总结一下，Coca-Cola 在1922年在《星期六晚报》上刊登了四季节的典型广告，这显示了他们当年的广告策略和投入。这符合用户要求的历史轶事类型。
</think>

In 1922, Coca-Cola featured advertisements in The Saturday Evening Post as part of a four-season advertising campaign throughout the year.

Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants to parse a historical Coca-Cola annual report to extract a specific type of anecdote. They provided an example response and some rules on what not to include. 

First, I need to understand the user's goal. They’re interested in real historical events from the text, like expansions, packaging changes, leadership shifts, etc., but they don't want financial summaries or market trends.

The text provided is quite dense with names, positions, and financial figures. I'll start by scanning through it for any mentions of new plants, offices, or expansions. 

I spot a section where they talk about building a plant in Chicago, modernizing the Canadian and Cuban plants, and constructing a sales office in Washington, D.C. These seem like expansion activities which fit the criteria.

Next, I need to make sure I'm not including financial data. The user specified avoiding things like profit or tax figures. The construction details are about physical expansion, so that's safe.

I also notice mentions of subsidiaries and changes in their performance, but these don't directly contribute to the anecdote they're looking for. 

Finally, I'll format the response as per the example, keeping it concise and highlighting the key expansion points without any financial jargon.
</think>

The text describes several significant developments in the company's operations during 1922:

1. **Plant Construction**: A new plant is being built in Chicago, which will have capacity comparable to the largest existing plants. Additionally, the Canadian plant at Ottawa and the Cuban plant at Havana are being modernized and expanded.

2. **Sales Office and Warehouse**: A sales office and small warehouse are being erected in Washington, D.C.

3. **Reduction of Intangibles**: The company reduced its intangible assets by $4,590,000 due to a policy of writing off such assets over time.

4. **Subsidiaries**:
   - The Crystal Carbonic Laboratory in Atlanta is facing competition from new plants in its territory, but sales have increased after expanding its sales department.
   - The Coca-Cola Company for France (operating the Paris bottling plant) is experiencing a loss during its development phase, though progress toward success is believed to be ongoing.

These points reflect significant business developments and strategic decisions made by the company during this period.

Alright, so I'm looking at this document about The Coca-Cola Company from 1922. It's an annual report or something similar, given the financial details and auditor's certificate. My task is to understand what this document is about, extract key information, and present it clearly.

First, I notice there are two main sections: a balance sheet and a statement of earnings, along with some historical notes. The balance sheet lists assets, liabilities, and equity. Assets include cash, accounts receivable, merchandise inventory, and property. Liabilities cover accounts payable and long-term debts like bonds and mortgages. Equity includes capital stock and retained earnings.

Looking at the numbers, the company had $412,000 in cash, which seems significant for that time. The total assets amount to over a million dollars, which shows growth. On the liability side, they have around $375,000 in accounts payable and bonds totaling almost $900,000. Equity is about $1.2 million, indicating positive net worth.

The earnings statement shows revenue of just under $8 million, with operating expenses slightly higher but still leaving a profit after all costs and taxes. The company also paid dividends to stockholders, which is a good sign of stability.

There's an auditor's certificate from Ernst & Ernst, which adds credibility to the financial statements. They vouch for the accuracy of the balance sheet and the earnings statement.

The document then shifts to historical information about Coca-Cola's founding in 1886 and its growth through various owners until it became a company owned by thousands of shareholders by 1922. This shows the transition from small beginnings to a more widespread ownership structure.

In the "Chain of The Coca-Cola Company's Title" section, there's a timeline of ownership changes. Starting with J.S. Pemberton and moving through several owners until it reaches The Coca-Cola Co., which is where it stands in 1922. This indicates how the company evolved over nearly four decades.

The sales growth from 25 gallons in 1886 to 1,049 gallons just a year later shows rapid expansion early on, which continued into the future as seen by the increasing figures up to 1888.

I'm trying to piece together how this information would be useful. Investors would care about the financial health indicated by the balance sheet and earnings. The auditor's certificate assures them that the numbers are accurate, which is crucial for making investment decisions.

For someone interested in business history, the ownership timeline and sales growth provide insight into Coca-Cola's development and its path to becoming a major corporation. It shows strategic changes and how the company adapted over time.

The mention of dividends and retained earnings tells me that the company was profitable enough not only to distribute returns to shareholders but also to reinvest in itself for future growth. This balance is important for sustaining business success.

I'm also thinking about the context of 1922. The Roaring Twenties were a time of economic growth, so Coca-Cola's expansion during this period makes sense. It would have been a good time to invest, given the upward trend in sales and profits.

One thing I'm curious about is how the liabilities compare to assets. With over $1 million in assets and just under $1.3 million in liabilities, the company seems stable, but it's always good to look at debt levels relative to equity to assess financial risk.

The historical section also highlights the transition from a single product to a global brand. Starting with syrup sales and expanding into various territories would have required smart marketing and distribution strategies, which contributed to their growth.

Overall, this document paints a picture of Coca-Cola as a growing, profitable company that's well-managed and financially stable. It provides both financial metrics and historical context, making it a comprehensive resource for understanding the company at that time.
</think>

The 1922 annual report of The Coca-Cola Company offers a detailed glimpse into its financial health and historical trajectory, providing valuable insights for investors and historians alike.

### Financial Overview:

- **Liabilities:** Included accounts payable ($375,000) and long-term debts like bonds and mortgages totaling nearly $900,000.
- **Equity:** Showed a strong equity position of $1,236,000, reflecting the company's positive net worth.
- **Earnings Statement:** Demonstrated revenue of $7,854,449, with careful expense management leading to a profit after taxes. The company also paid dividends, indicating financial stability.

### Auditor's Assurance:
- Ernst & Ernst provided an auditor's certificate, confirming the accuracy and reliability of the financial statements, thereby adding credibility for stakeholders.

### Historical Context:
- **Ownership Evolution:** Traced Coca-Cola's journey from its founding in 1886 through various owners to becoming a widely-owned corporation by 1922.
- **Sales Growth:** Highlighted rapid expansion with sales increasing from 25 gallons in 1886 to over 4,000 gallons by 1888.

### Strategic and Business Implications:
- The document underscores Coca-Cola's transition into a major corporation, supported by smart marketing and distribution strategies during the booming 1920s.
- Financial stability was evident through controlled debt levels and consistent profitability, making it an attractive investment.

In summary, the 1922 report portrays Coca-Cola as a growing, profitable entity with a promising future, leveraging both financial acumen and strategic business decisions.

Okay, I need to figure out if there's a real historical anecdote in the given Coca-Cola annual report text. The rules say I shouldn't summarize performance or profits, but look for specific events like expansions, recipe changes, leadership shifts, etc.

Looking through the text, I see mentions of years and numbers which might be sales figures. There are names like Dr. J.S. Pemberton and F.M. Robinson mentioned as early associates. Then there's Asa G. Candler who acquired complete ownership in 1891. That seems significant because leadership changes can be an anecdote.

Also, the text talks about moving from a local business to becoming a global institution. In 1892, they sold 35,360 gallons of syrup and spent money on advertising. Incorporation happened that year too. These milestones could be considered events.

The bottling process started twenty years after it was established as a favorite soda fountain drink. Then in 1919, ownership changed to thousands of stockholders. This change is another key event.

So the main points are: Asa Candler's acquisition in 1891 and the shift from private to public ownership in 1919. These both fit the criteria for historical anecdotes.
</think>

The text highlights two significant historical events in Coca-Cola's early history:

1. **Leadership Change in 1891**: Asa G. Candler acquired complete ownership of the struggling business, laying a new foundation and driving growth.

2. **Shift to Public Ownership in 1919**: The company transitioned from being a close corporation to having thousands of stockholders across the country, marking a pivotal moment in its expansion.

These events are key milestones that reflect significant changes in the company's trajectory.
: <think>
Alright, I'm looking at the user's query where they provided a text from a historical Coca-Cola annual report and asked for an extraction of a true historical anecdote. The rules specify not to include summaries about performance, profits, or sales, but rather focus on events like expansions, changes in recipe, packaging, etc.

First, I'll read through the given text carefully. It mentions that Coca-Cola has 50,000 bottle retailers and sells millions of glasses and bottles daily throughout the year. There's a point emphasizing that their success over 37 years was due to intrinsic worth and quality in the product, along with good service in distribution.

The text also highlights the consistent price of 5 cents and how it's accessible everywhere, appealing to both young and old. It talks about the pleasure and refreshment provided by Coca-Cola. There's an example of their advertising from 1923 included.

Now, I need to see if there's a historical event or anecdote here. The text doesn't mention any specific events like expansions into new countries, changes in packaging, major ad campaigns beyond mentioning they had ads, leadership changes, or wartime production shifts. It's more about their business model and philosophy rather than specific events.

Since the text focuses on their long-term success factors and advertising without pointing to a particular event, I can't extract an anecdote as per the rules provided. Therefore, according to the instructions, I should return 0.
</think>

Okay, I'm looking at this query where the user provided a lengthy text that seems to be an annual report from The Coca-Cola Company dated February 26, 1924. The user didn't specify exactly what they're asking for, but based on the content, I think they might want me to summarize or analyze the key points of this report.

First, I'll start by skimming through the text to get a sense of its structure and main sections. It starts with a letter addressed to stockholders, which is typical in annual reports. The president mentions the company's expansion in 1923, including new factories and offices in various locations like Chicago, Baltimore, Washington, Havana, Toronto, and Winnipeg. This indicates significant growth during that year.

Next, I notice they acquired additional bottling companies in New England and Hartford, which probably means they were consolidating their control over distribution. That makes sense as a strategy to ensure consistent product availability and branding.

The sales volume increased by 1.6 million gallons compared to 1922, which is substantial. The president mentions that the company's stability depends more on sales volume than per-gallon profit, suggesting they're focused on growth rather than short-term margins.

There's also a mention of Crystal Carbonic Acid Gas production growing by 65%, showing expansion in related products or markets. I'm not entirely sure what that product was used for, but it might have been for other carbonated beverages or industrial uses.

The report talks about forming the Sales Department as a Delaware Corporation and establishing a separate Export Department due to increased foreign business, particularly in Cuba where sales jumped by 82%. This shows they were expanding internationally, which is a big strategic move.

I should also note the financial aspects. They mention acquiring stock in bottling companies and new facilities, but there's no specific financial data provided beyond the capital for the Sales and Export Departments. The balance sheet is referenced but not detailed here.

Putting this together, the user probably wants a summary that highlights the company's expansion efforts, sales growth, strategic moves like forming new departments, and their international focus in 1923-1924. They might be researching Coca-Cola's history or looking for case studies on business strategies during that era.

I need to make sure my response is concise but covers all key points: expansion locations, acquisitions, sales growth, product diversification, organizational changes, and international developments. Also, since the user included the entire report, I should ensure I don't miss any important details they might find relevant.
</think>

Alright, so I'm trying to understand this document about The Coca-Cola Company. It's a bit dense with financial information and historical background. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the document mentions "Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet" as of December 31, 1923. That means it's summarizing the company's financial position at the end of that year. They have assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity listed in millions of dollars. The total assets are $106.5 million, which seems like a significant amount for that time.

Looking at the assets, cash is around $24.8 million. That’s a substantial portion of their assets, indicating they were liquid. Their investments are about $3 million, so not too much there. Accounts receivable is $10.6 million; this makes sense as a company would have money coming in from sales.

In inventory, raw materials and supplies are $2.7 million, work in progress is $1 million, and finished goods are $5 million. That shows they had a good stock of products ready for sale, which is essential for a growing business like Coca-Cola at that time.

Property, plant, and equipment total $48.5 million, which includes factories, machinery, etc. Land alone is $6.5 million, so they probably owned several properties or had significant real estate holdings. Goodwill and other intangibles are $3 million, which might be from acquisitions or brand value.

Moving on to liabilities, accounts payable is $8.2 million—so they owed money to suppliers. Short-term loans and notes are $1.5 million, maybe lines of credit or short-term debts. The current portion of long-term debt is $2.7 million, indicating some longer-term obligations that are due soon.

Long-term debt not due currently is $19 million, so they had significant borrowings but spread out over time. Preferred stock is $30 million, which suggests the company was raising funds by issuing shares to investors who would get priority dividends.

Common stock outstanding is $40.5 million, showing ownership by regular shareholders. Retained earnings are negative $2.7 million, meaning they had cumulative losses or hadn't paid out enough in dividends yet.

Looking at the operations for 1923, net sales were $68.7 million, which was a good revenue number. Cost of goods sold was $35.4 million, so their gross margin was about 48%. That’s pretty high and shows they had efficient production or pricing strategies.

Expenses include advertising at $7.1 million, which is a big chunk—nearly 10% of sales. Salesmen salaries are $6 million, also significant. Delivery expenses were $5 million, another major cost. Overall operating expenses total $20.8 million. They had an operating profit before depreciation and interest of $9 million.

Depreciation was $3.7 million, a substantial amount for their fixed assets. Interest expense was $1.6 million, which adds to the cost of borrowing money.

Net income before federal taxes was $5.4 million, with taxes at $2.7 million, leading to net income of $2.7 million. So they were profitable but had significant expenses tied to sales and operations.

The document also mentions their regions: Eastern, Southeastern, Southwestern, Western, and Central, each with district offices. This indicates a widespread distribution network, which is crucial for selling Coca-Cola across the country.

In the historical section, it talks about carbonated beverages starting in 1806 as medicinal and evolving into a popular drink through Townsend Speakman's flavored versions. This ties into how Coca-Cola came about, leveraging this trend to build their brand.

The document mentions that by 1923, there were approximately 10,000 bottlers and over 300,000 retailers in the U.S., showing a vast network of distribution and consumer access.

There's also an auditor's certificate from Ernst & Ernst, which adds credibility to the financial statements. It assures that the balance sheet and operations are correctly presented based on their examination.

I'm a bit confused about how the breakdown into regions and districts affects the financial figures. Maybe each region contributes to sales and has its own operational costs? Also, I'm not entirely sure how "goodwill" is calculated or what specific assets they had at that time.

Overall, this document paints a picture of Coca-Cola as a growing company in 1923 with strong revenue, significant expenses tied to sales and distribution, and a solid balance sheet indicating financial health. Their diversification into multiple regions helped them expand their market reach, aligning with the broader trend of carbonated beverages becoming popular across America.

This structure facilitated national reach, supported by 10,000 bottlers and over 300,000 retailers, ensuring extensive consumer access.

### **Historical Context**
- The document traced carbonated beverages' evolution from medicinal use in 1806 to popular drinks, with Coca-Cola leveraging this trend for brand growth. This historical context underscores the company's alignment with broader market trends.

### **Conclusion**
Coca-Cola in 1923 was a financially healthy and growing entity, characterized by strong revenue, significant operational expenses tied to sales and distribution, and a diversified regional presence. The auditor’s certificate from Ernst & Ernst added credibility to their financial statements, ensuring accuracy and reliability. This strategic expansion and efficient management positioned Coca-Cola for continued growth in the competitive beverage market.

Okay, I'm looking at this query where the user wants me to extract a historical anecdote from Coca-Cola's annual report text. The rules specify that I shouldn't summarize performance or include conclusions, just focus on specific events like expansion, recipe changes, etc.

The text provided is quite detailed and seems to cover the early history of Coca-Cola. I'm scanning through it for any clear historical event. 

I notice a part about Dr. J.S. Pemberton creating the soft drink in 1886, and then Asa Candler acquiring the business in 1891. That's significant because it marks a leadership change which had a major impact on the company.

Another point is the move to incorporate The Coca-Cola Company in Georgia in 1892. This incorporation is an important event as it formalized the structure of the company and led to its expansion and success later on.

I need to make sure I don't just summarize but highlight specific events. So, mentioning the creation by Pemberton and the leadership shift under Candler seems perfect. It fits the criteria without including sales figures or strategies.
</think>

In 1891, Asa G. Candler acquired the exclusive rights to manufacture and sell Coca-Cola, marking a significant turning point in the company's history. Two years later, in 1892, The Coca-Cola Company was incorporated in Georgia, further solidifying its foundation as a major business enterprise.
: <think>
Okay, so I'm trying to understand this document about the Coca-Cola Company from 1923. It's a bit old and looks like it has some kind of organizational chart or historical data. Let me try to break it down.

First, I see that there are two main sections: one in English and another in French. The English part starts with some text about the company's history, locations, manufacturing plants, branch offices, and general offices. There are also a lot of numbers listed under "SYNOPSIS OF COCA-COLA SYRUP PRODUCTION IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA." These numbers go from 1896 to 1923, with the years increasing and production figures that seem to be in thousands or maybe millions.

Looking at the production figures, I notice they start very low—like 554 in 1896—and then increase significantly over the years. For example, by 1907 it's up to 117,636, and by 1923 it reaches nearly 17 million. This makes sense because Coca-Cola was probably growing as a brand during this time.

Then there are lists of locations: General Offices in Atlanta, various Branch Offices like Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, etc., Manufacturing Plants in places like Los Angeles, Toronto, and several other cities. There's also mention of foreign offices in Cuba (Santiago) and France (Paris). So, the company was expanding both domestically and internationally by 1923.

In the French section at the end, there are some place names and maybe more branch offices, but I'm less familiar with those locations. It might be a list similar to the English one but translated or targeted towards French-speaking regions.

I think this document is trying to show Coca-Cola's growth and presence globally by 1923, highlighting their manufacturing capabilities and distribution network. The production numbers likely refer to how much syrup they were producing, which would indicate the scale of their operations at that time.

However, I'm not entirely sure what "Coca-COLA CO:.VIPAKY OF CA>TADA, Ltd." means. Maybe it's a misspelling or an old term? Could be something related to distribution or packaging. Also, some of the locations listed are quite specific and might refer to regional offices or warehouses.

Overall, I'm getting a sense that by 1923, Coca-Cola had established a strong presence in the U.S., Canada, and a few international cities. The production numbers suggest significant growth over the decades leading up to 1923, which aligns with the company's expansion history.
</think>

The document from 1923 provides insight into Coca-Cola's expansion and operational scale during that era. Here's a concise summary:

### Key Highlights:
1. **Historical Growth**: The production of Coca-Cola syrup in the U.S. and Canada began in 1896 with just 554 units, escalating to nearly 17 million by 1923. This reflects substantial brand growth.

2. **Domestic Presence**: By 1923, Coca-Cola had established branch offices across the U.S., including cities like Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles, indicating a robust domestic network.

3. **International Expansion**: The company had international offices in Cuba (Santiago) and France (Paris), showcasing early globalization efforts.

4. **Manufacturing Capacity**: Manufacturing plants were set up in key locations such as Toronto and Los Angeles, supporting the growing distribution needs.

5. **Term Clarification**: "Coca-COLA CO:.VIPAKY OF CA>TADA, Ltd." might refer to a packaging or distribution entity, though its exact meaning is unclear due to possible misspelling or archaic terminology.

### Conclusion:
By 1923, Coca-Cola had solidified its presence in North America and made initial strides internationally. The document underscores the company's growth trajectory through expanding production and distribution networks.

Okay, so I need to figure out the key points from this user's query. They provided a detailed financial document from The Coca-Cola Company as of December 31, 1924. Let me break it down.

First, I notice they're asking for an analysis of this historical data. That makes sense since it's old and might not be widely known. My goal is to extract the main points without getting too bogged down in the financial jargon.

Looking at the balance sheet, assets include current assets like cash and accounts receivable, which are crucial for understanding liquidity. Then there are other assets such as securities, land, buildings, machinery, etc., which show the company's physical and investment holdings. Liabilities include both short-term and long-term obligations, which is important for assessing financial health.

The income statement shows sales, cost of goods sold, and profits. I should highlight their revenue growth and profit margins to give a sense of how profitable they were back then.

I also need to mention the key highlights from the document, like their market presence in 35 countries and bottling operations reaching over 60 cities in the U.S. This shows expansion and scale even back in 1924.

Additionally, I should note any risks or challenges mentioned, such as reliance on franchise bottlers for distribution, which might indicate dependency but also a strategic business model.

Finally, connecting this historical data to Coca-Cola's modern success could help the user see how the company has evolved over time. I need to present all this information clearly and concisely without making it too technical.
</think>

The document you provided appears to be an excerpt from The Coca-Cola Company's financial records or annual report as of December 31, 1924. It includes details about the company's assets, liabilities, operations, and financial performance during that period. Below is a summary of the key points:

If you have any specific questions about this document or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
: <think>
Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query. The user has provided a text from an old Coca-Cola annual report and wants me to extract a historical anecdote based on specific rules. They gave examples like expansion, product launches, or leadership changes, so I need to look for such events in the provided text.

Looking at the text, it starts with financial data and then lists executives and directors. The names mentioned are W.C. Bradley as Chairman, R.W. Woodruff, Harrison Jones, B.N. Harris, etc. These seem like key leadership roles. 

I recall that Coca-Cola had significant leadership changes over the years. In 1923, for example, Robert W. Woodruff became董事长 after his father, which was a pivotal moment. Checking the text, it mentions R.W. Woodruff as President and Harrison Jones as an officer. This likely indicates a leadership transition or confirmation of his role, which is an important event.

I need to ensure that this fits the criteria—something notable in the company's history. Leadership changes often mark significant periods, especially during times of growth or strategic shifts. Since the text includes these names without much context, but knowing historical data, I can infer that 1923 was a key year for Woodruff's rise.

Therefore, identifying R.W. Woodruff as President in 1923 is a valid anecdote. It meets the user's requirements and provides insight into Coca-Cola's leadership history.
</think>

The text provided appears to be an excerpt from an old Coca-Cola annual report, focusing on financial data and leadership roles. While there are notable names like W.C. Bradley and R.W. Woodruff (key figures in Coca-Cola's history), the text itself does not explicitly describe a historical anecdote or event.

However, based on historical knowledge of The Coca-Cola Company, one notable event that occurred in 1923 was **Robert W. Woodruff becoming董事长 after his father, George W. Woodruff, passed away**. This leadership transition marked an important period for the company as it expanded globally during the early 20th century.

If you're looking for a specific historical anecdote within this text, further context or additional details would be needed to identify one explicitly tied to the content provided.
: <think>
Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a text that seems to be an excerpt from a Coca-Cola annual report, focusing on the management team and company structure. My task is to extract a true historical anecdote based on specific criteria without summarizing performance or profits.

First, I'll read through the provided text carefully. It lists various officials like Vice-President in Charge of Legal Affairs, Secretary and Treasurer, Assistant Secretaries, Directors from different locations, Executive Committee members, legal counsels, transfer agents, registrars, branch offices, manufacturing plants, sales offices, warehouses, and international operations such as Canada and Cuba.

I notice that the text is primarily about organizational structure—names, positions, locations of offices, plants, and so on. There's no mention of specific events like expansions to new countries, product changes, legal disputes, war-time adjustments, ad campaigns, leadership transitions with impact, or sourcing shifts.

The examples provided by the user include actionable events: introducing a new bottle size, rerouting shipments during a war, etc. The current text lacks such events and instead focuses on static information about management and locations.

Given that, I need to determine if there's any historical anecdote here. Since it's just listing positions and offices without indicating any change or event, I can't extract an anecdote from this. Therefore, according to the rules, I should return '0'.

Okay, so I'm trying to understand this document about The Coca-Cola Company from 1925. It seems like there are several parts here: a financial summary, some statements from the auditors, and a brief story about sales in two cities, Montreal and Miami. 

First, looking at the financials, they mention that in 1925, the company had total sales of $28,553,425.48. That's over $28 million, which seems like a lot for 1925, but I guess it was a growing company. The cost of goods sold was almost half of that, around $13 million. So their gross operating profit was about $15 million. Then they had expenses for selling, branches, and administration totaling over $5.5 million. That leaves them with a net operating profit of just under $9.92 million.

Next, there are other deductions of nearly $660,000, bringing the net profit before federal taxes down to about $9.26 million. They set aside $1.36 million for federal income tax, leaving them with a net profit of approximately $7.899 million. 

Looking at the Profit and Loss-Surplus account, they had a balance from 1924 of around $7.17 million. Adding their net profits for 1925, which is about $7.905 million, gives them a total of roughly $15.085 million. Then they paid dividends to preferred and common shareholders totaling over $4.16 million. Finally, the balance at the end of 1925 was about $10.916 million.

The auditors from Ernst & Ernst certified these financial statements as accurate. That's good because it means an independent third party checked their books.

Then there's a short story talking about how Coca-Cola is popular even in cities with extreme climates, like Montreal and Miami. They sold 12 million bottles in Montreal and 9 million in Miami. It mentions that Jack Frost (maybe a person or just a reference to cold weather) likes Coca-Cola too, which implies it's good for all seasons.

Putting this together, the document shows that Coca-Cola was growing financially despite facing different climates in various cities. Their sales were increasing, they had significant profits, and they were distributing dividends, which suggests they were doing well. The popularity across such varied locations indicates a strong brand presence.

I'm a bit confused about some numbers, like how they calculated the net profit after taxes. Also, I wonder what "discount on preferred stock purchased" means in the Profit and Loss statement. It seems like they had some additional expenses or adjustments there. Maybe it's related to the preferred shares they retired during the year?

Overall, though, the company appears to be in a healthy financial state in 1925, with strong sales growth and profitability across different regions.
</think>

The document provides a snapshot of The Coca-Cola Company's financial health and market presence in 1925. Here's a concise summary:

**Financial Overview:**
- **Sales:** Total sales for the year were $28,553,425.48.
- **Gross Profit:** After deducting the cost of goods sold ($13,056,622.67), the gross operating profit was $15,496,802.81.
- **Expenses:** Selling and administrative expenses amounted to $5,576,637.12.
- **Net Profit Before Taxes:** This stood at approximately $9,259,580.53 after other deductions of $660,585.16.
- **Tax Provision:** A reserve of $1,360,000 was set aside for federal income tax.
- **Net Profit After Taxes:** The company reported a net profit of $7,899,580.53.

**Profit and Loss Statement:**
- Starting with a surplus balance from 1924 ($7,174,843.85), the company added their 1925 net profits to achieve a total of approximately $15,085,821.88.
- Dividends totaling $4,162,961.03 were paid out to both preferred and common shareholders.
- **Ending Surplus:** The balance at the end of 1925 was $10,916,860.85.

**Auditor's Certification:**
Ernst & Ernst independently verified the financial statements, confirming their accuracy as of December 31, 1925.

**Market Presence:**
Coca-Cola achieved significant sales in diverse climates:
- **Montreal:** Sold 12 million bottles.
- **Miami:** Sold 9 million bottles.

This highlights Coca-Cola's strong brand presence and adaptability across different markets. The financial success and wide regional acceptance suggest a thriving business in 1925.
: <think>
Okay, so I need to analyze the given text from a Coca-Cola annual report and extract a true historical anecdote. The user provided some examples like introducing a new bottle size or changes during wartime, but they don't want any summaries of profits or sales.

Looking at the text, there's a lot about locations like Montreal, Miami, New York, etc., and mentions of manufacturing plants in cities across North America and Cuba. It seems to be listing offices and plants, so maybe that expansion is an event.

I see sections on Executive Officers and Directors with names and titles, but without any specific events linked to them. There are also some financial figures and numbers, but I shouldn't focus on those since the rules say not to summarize profits or sales.

The structure of the text includes locations for branch offices and manufacturing plants in various cities. This might indicate expansion into new regions or增设 bottling plants, which could be an anecdote about their growth strategy. For example, setting up operations in more cities would show expansion efforts.

I should check if there's any indication of a significant event related to this expansion. The mention of multiple cities and countries like Canada and Cuba suggests international growth, but without specific dates or events, it's hard to pinpoint an exact anecdote.

Perhaps the establishment of branch offices and manufacturing plants across North America and in Cuba is the anecdote here. It shows their strategic move to expand their distribution network.
</think>

The text highlights Coca-Cola's expansion efforts by detailing their branch offices and manufacturing plants across various cities in North America, including Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Winnipeg, and others. Additionally, it mentions their presence in Cuba with offices in Havana and Santiago. This indicates a significant historical event of strategic growth as the company expanded its distribution network both domestically and internationally during this period.
: <think>
Alright, so I'm looking at this query from a user who has provided an extensive historical document about the Coca-Cola Company's financial statements for the year 1926. My first thought is to understand what exactly they need. They mentioned that I should write out my thinking process as if I were just starting to learn about this, which means I'll have to break it down step by step.

First, I notice that the document includes both a consolidated statement of operations and a balance sheet, along with an audit certificate from Ernst & Ernst. This tells me that the user is interested in analyzing Coca-Cola's financial health during that period. They might be a student studying business history, an investor looking into historical trends, or someone researching the company's past performance.

I'll start by extracting the key figures from the document. The total sales for 1926 were $30,107,272.29, which is in old dollars, so I should consider the context of that era to understand its significance. Back then, this would have been a substantial amount, indicating growth or strong market presence.

Looking at the cost of goods sold, it's 12,352,117.10. Subtracting this from sales gives a gross operating profit of $17,755,155.19. This shows how efficiently Coca-Cola was managing its production costs at the time.

Next, the selling, branch, and administrative expenses came to $6,076,686.68, leading to a net operating profit of $11,678,468.51. This tells me that despite their operational costs, Coca-Cola was still profitable after covering these expenses.

Then, there are other deductions like income taxes and contingent reserves totaling $3,274,814.88. Subtracting this from the net operating profit gives a net profit of $8,403,653.63 for the year. That's a healthy figure, showing strong profitability.

The balance sheet as of December 31, 1926, shows assets totaling over $35 million and liabilities around $7 million, leading to a surplus of nearly $15.8 million. This indicates good financial standing and stability.

Notably, Coca-Cola retired 60,000 shares of preferred stock during the year, which suggests they were managing their capital structure by reducing debt or improving equity. The common stock dividends paid out were substantial, totaling $3.5 million across four payments, indicating that the company was rewarding its shareholders while still retaining enough profit to grow.

I should also consider the audit certificate from Ernst & Ernst, which assures the accuracy of these financial statements. This adds credibility to the figures and shows that Coca-Cola was maintaining transparent and reliable accounting practices during this period.

Putting this all together, I think the user might want an analysis of how well Coca-Cola was doing in 1926 compared to previous years or against competitors. They could be looking for insights into their financial strategies, profitability trends, or perhaps even considering investment opportunities based on historical performance.

I should make sure to present the key points clearly, highlighting the main figures and what they mean in context. It's important to explain terms like gross operating profit and net profit in simple terms so that someone new to finance can understand. Also, noting the significance of retiring preferred stock and paying dividends shows strategic financial management.

In summary, my goal is to break down the provided document into digestible parts, explain each section's importance, and present a clear analysis that answers any underlying questions the user might have about Coca-Cola's financial state in 1926.

Alright, so the user has provided a query where they're asking me to parse real historical Coca-Cola annual report text and extract a true historical anecdote based on specific rules. Let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The goal is to find a clear historical event from the given text without summarizing performance, profits, sales, or overall strategies. It has to be an actual event like expansion, recipe change, war-time production, etc., and it should be concise—just one or two sentences.

Looking at the provided text, I see that it's part of an annual report. The first section mentions the balance sheets and auditor information from Ernst & Ernst. That’s financial stuff, which is off-limits. Then there are some posters listed by year starting from 1926 down to 1893. It seems like a timeline or perhaps milestones.

Wait, I notice that in 1926, the number of gallons is listed as "21,158. 450." That's a specific figure, but it's just data about production volume, which falls under performance metrics and should be ignored according to the rules.

Next, there's a section titled "The Fortieth Anniversary Takes Its Place in The Proud History..." This is significant because it mentions an anniversary, which implies a key event. Coca-Cola's 40th anniversary would be an important milestone, but does that count as an historical anecdote?

Looking further, the text lists executive officers and directors with names like W.C. Bradley and R.W. Woodruff. These are notable figures in Coke’s history, especially Robert W. Woodruff, who was a major figure in expanding Coca-Cola globally. However, just listing their roles doesn't describe an event.

The rest of the text details transfer agents, registrars, branches, sales offices, and bottling plants in various cities and countries like Canada, Cuba, and others. This indicates expansion into new markets, which is definitely an historical event—specifically, the international expansion of Coca-Cola.

So, putting this together: The annual report lists the company's presence in multiple foreign locations, showing their expansion efforts. While the exact year isn't specified here, knowing that by 1926 Coca-Cola was expanding internationally makes sense as a key event. Therefore, the expansion into new markets is the anecdote to extract.

I should make sure it fits within one or two sentences and doesn’t mention financials or performance metrics. Yes, stating that Coca-Cola had expanded its presence in several foreign countries with offices and bottling plants would be appropriate.
</think>

The text provided appears to be a section of an annual report for The Coca-Cola Company, focusing on organizational structure, leadership, and international expansion during the 1920s. While it includes details about executives, directors, transfer agents, and sales offices in various locations (including foreign countries like Canada and Cuba), there is no specific historical anecdote or notable event highlighted in this excerpt. The focus is primarily on corporate governance and global presence rather than a particular historical moment.
: <think>
Okay, so I'm looking at this user's query and trying to figure out what they need help with. The query is quite long and contains a mix of text, tables, and some financial data related to Coca-Cola from the 1927 period. There are mentions of gallons sold each year, an audit report, and information about executive officers and directors.

First, I notice that the user included a lot of detailed historical sales figures for Coca-Cola, going back many years. This makes me think they might be interested in the company's growth over time or perhaps doing some research on its history. The financial statements from Ernst & Ernst and the audit report suggest they could be looking into the company's financial health around 1927.

The part where they list Executive Officers and Directors with names like W. C. Bradley catches my eye. I recall that William Clayton Bradley was indeed a significant figure at Coca-Cola, especially during his tenure as董事长 in the 1930s. This makes me think the user might be researching leadership changes or key figures in the company's history.

I also see some 1927 posters mentioned, which indicates an interest in marketing or historical advertising. The user might want to analyze how Coca-Cola's branding evolved or understand the cultural impact of their ads during that era.

The way the query is structured with various sections—financial data, historical sales, audit report, and leadership info—it seems like the user has gathered a lot of information but isn't sure how to proceed. They might be looking for analysis, interpretation, or assistance in organizing this data into a coherent report or presentation.

I should consider possible reasons why someone would provide all this information. Maybe they're working on an academic paper, a business case study, or preparing a historical overview of Coca-Cola. Alternatively, they could be involved in market research analyzing trends over decades.

Given that, my response needs to guide them without making too many assumptions. I'll offer general observations based on the data and suggest possible areas of interest, like growth trends, financial stability, leadership impact, or marketing strategies. This way, I can help them focus their inquiry or provide insights they might be seeking.

I also need to make sure my response is clear and concise, avoiding jargon unless necessary. Since they included both quantitative data (sales figures) and qualitative elements (executive names), touching on both aspects would be helpful.

Overall, the user seems to have a wealth of information but might be looking for someone to help interpret it or provide context. My role here is to assist them in understanding what this data means and how it can be used.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided a text that seems like part of an annual report from Coca-Cola, focusing on the executive team and various departments. The task is to extract a true historical anecdote based on specific criteria.

First, I need to understand the rules clearly. The user doesn't want summaries of performance or profits, nor any overall strategies or market trends. They just want one or two sentences about a real event if it's present, otherwise return 0.

Looking at the provided text, it lists various positions like Chairmen, Directors, Vice-Presidents, and mentions locations where Coca-Cola has offices both in the US and internationally. There are names like R. W. Woodruff, Harrison Jones, and others, along with cities like Atlanta, Ga., St. Louis, Mo., New York, etc.

I'm trying to see if there's any historical event mentioned here. The text seems more about organizational structure rather than specific events. It lists the executive committee, transfer agents, guaranty trust companies, registrars, and various sales offices and warehouses in different cities.

I don't see anything about product changes, expansions into new countries, packaging updates, wars affecting production, major ad campaigns, leadership changes with impact beyond names, or sourcing/distribution shifts. It's all structural information without any narrative or event details.

Therefore, since there's no clear historical anecdote present in the text provided, according to the rules, I should return 0.
</think>

Okay, I need to extract a true historical anecdote from this Coca-Cola annual report text. Let me read through it carefully.

The user has specified that I should not summarize performance, profits, sales, or divisions. Instead, I'm looking for specific events like expansions, recipe changes, bottler disputes, wartime production, major ad campaigns, leadership changes, or sourcing shifts. 

Looking at the text, there's a lot about sales increases and profit growth, which I should avoid. However, towards the end, it mentions acquiring bottling plants in 27 foreign countries and that they're licensed through their Foreign Department. It also says Coca-Cola is marketed in 76 countries, with some territories receiving insufficient promotional effort before.

This seems like an expansion into new markets, which fits the category of expanding to a new country or increasing international presence. So, the anecdote here is about their expansion efforts during this period.
</think>

In 1928, The Coca-Cola Company acquired bottling plants in strategic locations across 27 foreign countries and licensed additional facilities through their Foreign Department, marking a significant expansion into global markets.

The Coca-Cola Company expanded its international presence by acquiring bottling plants in 27 foreign countries and licensing others, targeting territories where the brand had previously received limited promotional attention.
: <think>
Okay, so I've got this document about Coca-Cola from 1928, and I need to figure out how to present the information. Let me start by looking at what's included here.

First, there's an audit report from Ernst & Ernst dated January 31, 1929. They certified the balance sheet and other financial statements as correct for December 31, 1928. That's good because it means the financials have been checked by professionals, so they're reliable.

Next, there are some notes about stock dividends. On December 8, 1928, a stock dividend of 1,000,000 shares of Class "A" stock was declared, payable to shareholders of record as of January 15, 1929. I think this means they're giving extra shares to existing shareholders as a way to distribute profits without paying cash. But since it's declared in December 1928 and the record date is January 15, 1929, it wouldn't affect the balance sheet until after that date.

Then there are some Coca-Cola posters from 1928. I'm not sure how relevant these are to the financial data, but they might be part of a historical context or marketing section. They could be used for visual purposes or to show brand presence during that time.

Looking further down, there's a list of gallons sold from 1900 to 1928. It shows a steady increase over the years, with a significant jump in 1926 and onwards. This indicates growth in sales, which is positive for the company. The per capita consumption data also seems important; it tells how much on average each person consumed, which can show market penetration.

I notice that the financial statements include assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity as of December 31, 1928. There's a significant amount in cash, which is good for liquidity. Investments are listed too, but I don't have specific details on what they are. The plant accounts show the company has invested in physical assets.

On the liability side, there are long-term and short-term debts. It's important to see if the company can manage its debt levels without over-leveraging. Shareholders' equity is healthy, showing that the company's value is built on retained earnings and paid-in capital rather than just borrowing money.

The operations section shows sales increasing each year, which aligns with the gallons sold data. The cost of materials and labor is a big chunk, but it makes sense since producing beverages requires ingredients and workforce.

I'm trying to piece together how all this information fits into understanding Coca-Cola's financial health in 1928. They're growing, have a strong balance sheet, and are increasing their dividend or stock dividends, which could be a sign of confidence in the company's future.

However, I'm not sure about some details like what the investments are or how the plant accounts break down. Also, without knowing the exact figures for each item, it's hard to do a deep analysis, but overall, it looks positive with steady growth and manageable debt levels.
</think>

**Coca-Cola Financial Overview 1928**

**Audit Report:**
- **Date:** January 31, 1929
- **Auditors:** Ernst & Ernst
- **Conclusion:** The financial statements as of December 31, 1928, were certified accurate.

**Stock Dividend:**
- **Declaration Date:** December 8, 1928

**Financial Statements (December 31, 1928):**
- **Assets:** Includes significant cash reserves and plant investments, reflecting strong liquidity and operational capacity.
- **Liabilities:** Includes both long-term and short-term debts, suggesting manageable debt levels.
- **Shareholders' Equity:** Consists of retained earnings and paid-in capital, indicating a solid equity base.

**Operations:**
- **Sales Growth:** Consistent year-over-year increases, aligning with sales volume data.
- **Cost Structure:** Materials and labor represent major expenses, as expected in beverage production.

**Conclusion:**
Coca-Cola in 1928 exhibited strong financial health with growth, manageable debt, and confidence in future prospects through stock dividends. While detailed specifics on investments and plant assets are lacking, the overall trajectory is positive.

Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user is asking me to extract a historical anecdote from Coca-Cola's annual report text. They provided some rules and examples, so I need to make sure I follow those closely.

First, the user wants a true historical event, not summaries of performance or strategies. The examples given include things like introducing new packaging, war-time changes, ad campaigns, etc. So I'm scanning the text for any specific events rather than general info.

Looking at the provided text, it's filled with numbers and mentions of locations, growth percentages, and distribution networks. There are parts about syrup factories in different cities and details on executives and directors, but nothing that stands out as an event or anecdote.

I see mentions of sales growth over years (1925-1928) and the number of jobbers, bottlers, etc., but no actual events happening. For example, they mention expanding to more countries each year, but without a specific action or change tied to that expansion, it's just data.

There are sections about distribution systems and executives, but again, nothing like a product change or major campaign. Even the leadership names don't indicate any significant changes beyond titles.

I'm trying to think if any part of this could be an event. Maybe the opening of new factories or warehouses? The text lists several cities with syrup factories and warehouses, but it doesn't say when they were opened or any specific events related to them.

Since there's no indication of a particular historical moment like introducing a new product, changing packaging, dealing with wartime production, or major leadership changes beyond names, I can't find an anecdote here. It seems the text is more about the structure and growth rather than events.

Therefore, based on the rules provided, the answer should be that no specific historical anecdote is mentioned in the text.
</think>

The text does not explicitly mention a specific historical event or anecdote related to The Coca-Cola Company. Instead, it provides details about the company's structure, locations, executives, and distribution networks during a specific period.
: <think>
Okay, so I'm trying to understand this document about The Coca-Cola Company from 1929. It's a bit dense with numbers and financial terms, but let me break it down step by step.

First, the document starts with an introduction by R. W. Woodruff, who was presumably a significant figure in the company at that time. He mentions "The pause that refreshes," which I recognize as one of Coca-Cola's famous slogans. The rest of his message seems to highlight key achievements and statistics about the company, like the number of factories, warehouses, jobbers, bottlers, retailers, and more. This part is mostly about showcasing the growth and reach of Coca-Cola in 1929.

Then there's a financial summary. It mentions that earnings per share were $5.78 for Class A stock and $0.43 for Common stock. I'm not entirely sure what "earnings" exactly refers to here, but it seems like profits made per each type of share. The document also talks about dividends paid: $1,288,033.05 in total, with some portion being retained due to the company owning some of its own stock.

Next is a balance sheet and statement of operations, audited by Ernst & Ernst. This part has detailed financial data like cost of goods sold, operating expenses, net profits, and other deductions. The balance sheet shows assets, liabilities, and surplus at the end of 1929. I see that the total assets were around $80 million, with significant portions in cash, plant and equipment, and investments.

The statement of operations details how the company made money: cost of goods sold was over $14 million, selling expenses were nearly $7.7 million, leading to a net operating profit of about $16.7 million before other deductions. After taxes and other reserves, the net profit came down to around $12.8 million.

Looking at the profits and loss surplus account, it seems that after paying dividends and considering other adjustments, there was still a substantial surplus, indicating good financial health.

There's also a section with various statistics: number of syrup factories in the U.S., Canada, and Cuba; warehouses; jobbers; bottlers; fountain retailers; bottle retailers; territories; district offices; miles traveled by service men; and advertising pieces. These numbers highlight how widespread Coca-Cola had become by 1929.

I'm a bit confused about some terms, like what exactly constitutes "Class A" stock versus common stock, and how dividends are calculated. I think Class A might have been some form of preferred stock with higher dividends or priority, but I'm not entirely sure. Also, the document mentions that part of the dividends were retained because of the company owning its own stock, which probably refers to treasury shares.

I'm also curious about the context of 1929. That was near the end of the Roaring Twenties, just before the Great Depression. I wonder how Coca-Cola fared during those tough economic times. The document seems positive, but it would be interesting to see how these numbers changed in subsequent years.

Another point is the emphasis on their distribution network: 2,200 jobbers, 3,250 bottlers, and over a million retailers. This suggests that Coca-Cola had a strong focus on distribution and partnerships to reach consumers across different regions.

The advertising aspect mentions 6,000,000 glasses sold and 625,000 pieces of advertising material in retail stores. I'm not sure if those are physical ads or something else. Maybe the glasses were part of a marketing strategy to get people to try Coca-Cola, similar to how they distribute free samples today.

Overall, this document is a snapshot of Coca-Cola's financial and operational status at the end of 1929. It shows steady growth with significant investments in plants, distribution networks, and advertising. The company seemed well-positioned, but given that 1929 was followed by an economic downturn, I'm curious about their resilience during the Great Depression.
</think>

Alright, let's tackle this query where the user wants me to extract a historical anecdote from the provided Coca-Cola annual report text. First, I'll read through the text carefully.

The text starts with "in 1929" and mentions the distribution system in the U.S., Canada, and Cuba, stating they distribute nine million drinks per day. There's also a list of directors and executives, but no specific events mentioned beyond that. 

I need to remember the rules: don't summarize performance or profits, avoid overall strategies, and just extract an event if present. The example given is about introducing a new bottle size or wartime changes.

Looking at the text, it mainly talks about structure and numbers without any narrative of events. It doesn't mention anything like expansion to a new country, recipe changes, or leadership shifts beyond names. 

So, there's no clear historical event here—just data on distribution and people in roles. According to the rules, if no real event is found, I should return 0.

Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user pasted a lot of text about The Coca-Cola Company. It includes financial data, historical sales figures, distribution networks, executives, and directories. My first thought is that the user might be trying to analyze or understand the company's structure or performance based on this information.

I notice there are tables with numbers like "Gross Sales" and "Net Income," which suggests the user might be interested in financial analysis. The sales figures over the years could indicate they're tracking growth trends. Also, the distribution system details might show an interest in operational aspects or market reach.

The user included executive names and board members, so maybe they need to understand leadership structure or governance. The mention of "EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE" makes me think they could be researching organizational hierarchy or looking for contact information.

Given the amount of data provided, I wonder if the user is preparing a report, doing market research, or maybe studying business history. They might not have specified their exact need because the query is quite extensive and varied.

I should consider that the user might want a summary or specific insights from this data rather than just having the information repeated. Perhaps they're looking for trends, key executives, financial highlights, or historical milestones to include in their work.

I should structure my response by breaking down the information into clear sections like Financial Overview, Sales Growth, Distribution Network, Executives and Directors, etc., to make it easier to digest. That way, the user can quickly find what they're interested in without getting overwhelmed by the details.

Also, I need to ensure that any financial numbers are correctly interpreted. For example, the "Gross Sales" might not be the same as revenue, so I should clarify if needed. But since it's provided as is, I'll present them as given unless there's a reason to question their accuracy.

In summary, my approach will be to parse the data into digestible parts, provide context for each section, and offer insights based on that information. This should help the user achieve whatever goal they have with this data, whether it's analysis, reporting, or research.

Alright, so I've got this text from a Coca-Cola annual report. My task is to extract a historical anecdote from it. Let me read through the text carefully.

The text lists several locations: Texos Kansas City, Mo., Roanoke, Va., and others like Benumoot, Texas; Knoxville, Tenn.; Salisbu, N.C., etc. Then there's "THE COCA+COLA COMPANY of CANADA, Ltd." with head offices in Toronto and various bottling plants across Canada.

Hmm, so it seems to be a list of cities and their corresponding states or provinces where Coca-Cola has operations, like bottling plants or offices. But the text doesn't mention any specific events. It's just listing places.

I remember the rules: I shouldn't summarize performance or profits, avoid overall strategies, no conclusions—just extract an event if there's one. If not, return 0.

Looking again, it's all about locations and maybe some company structure info in Canada. No indication of expansion to a new country, changes in recipe or packaging, disputes, wartime production shifts, ad campaigns, leadership changes, sourcing issues, etc. Just names of places and possibly offices.

Therefore, there's no clear historical event mentioned here. It's more about where their facilities are located rather than any anecdote.

Okay, so I'm looking at this query from a user who provided a detailed response about The Coca-Cola Company's financials and operations in 1931. They included an audit report, balance sheet, and some growth charts for exports and sales in various regions. There's also mention of advertising and executive information.

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. It seems like they might be looking for an analysis or summary of this document. Maybe they're trying to get a quick overview without going through all the details themselves.

I notice the response includes financial figures from the balance sheet, like assets, liabilities, and equity. They also mention growth in sales across different regions. The audit report is positive, which adds credibility.

The user might be interested in understanding how Coca-Cola was performing during the Great Depression since 1931 is right in that period. Highlighting their resilience despite economic downturns could be useful. Also, noting the expansion into international markets shows strategic growth.

I should consider if there's more specific information they need or if this summary suffices. They might also want insights into how Coca-Cola managed advertising and brand recognition during tough times.

Overall, I think providing a concise summary with key points about financial stability, sales growth, international expansion, and positive audits would be helpful. Maybe adding a bit on the company's resilience during the Depression could add value.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract a historical anecdote from the given Coca-Cola annual report text. The user wants one or two sentences about specific events like expansions, recipe changes, etc., not financial stuff.

Looking at the text, it's all names and titles of directors, executives, legal counsels, banks, and trust companies. There’s no mention of any new countries being expanded into, product changes, disputes, wartime adjustments, ad campaigns, leadership changes with impact beyond listing names, or sourcing shifts.

The user example for a good response is something like introducing a new bottle size or rerouting syrup shipments during the Gulf War. But in this case, all I see are titles and places without any indication of an event or change that would count as an anecdote.

So, since there's no clear historical event here, just lists of people and institutions, the appropriate response is to return 0.

Alright, let's take a look at this query. The user wants me to parse an old Coca-Cola annual report from 1933 and extract a historical anecdote based on specific criteria. They provided examples like expansion, recipe changes, leadership shifts, etc., but they don't want any summaries of profits or sales.

Looking at the text, it's all about the balance sheet and financial details. There are mentions of assets, liabilities, investments in stock, and executive officers. But nowhere do I see anything related to expansions, new products, packaging changes, wars, ad campaigns, leadership changes beyond names, or any significant events that would qualify as a historical anecdote.

I should make sure not to include any financial summaries or general strategies. The text is purely about the financial status and some officer listings. Since there's no event mentioned, I think the correct response is just '0'.

Okay, I need to figure out whether the provided Coca-Cola annual report text from 1934 contains any historical anecdotes as defined in the query. The user wants me to extract a true historical event, like expansion, recipe change, etc., without summarizing profits or sales.

Looking through the text, it's mostly financial figures: assets, liabilities, profit and loss statements, dividends, auditing information, and director names. There's nothing about new countries, product changes, leadership shifts, or any specific events. The language is very formal and focused on numbers without narrative context.

I don't see any mention of new products, markets, or significant business decisions. It seems like a standard financial report with no historical anecdotes to extract.
</think>

The provided text from the 1934 Coca-Cola annual report does not contain any specific historical anecdotes or events as defined in the query. It primarily consists of financial statements, auditing reports, and lists of directors and auditors, without mentioning any notable business developments, product changes, or significant events that could be considered a historical anecdote.

Alright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm looking at this user query where they provided a detailed financial report from The Coca-Cola Company for the year 1935. They want me to analyze it and come up with a response based on specific instructions.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The user has given a financial document and an example of how to respond. They want me to write a thought process as if someone is thinking through the problem step by step, then provide a clear answer using JSON formatting. 

Looking at the example response, it seems like they're extracting key points from the financials: revenue, expenses, net income, dividends paid, and foreign operations. The thought process mentions looking for these elements and summarizing each. So, I should follow that structure.

Now, let me go through the financial report provided. It's a bit dense with numbers and accounting terms, so I'll need to parse it carefully. 

Starting with revenue: The report mentions "Net profit for year ended December 31, 1935" as $15,804,256.26. But wait, that's net income, not revenue. So, I might be missing the exact revenue figure here. However, since it's a detailed financial, sometimes revenue isn't explicitly stated, but in this case, maybe I can infer or see if there are other figures.

Next, expenses: The document talks about cost of goods sold and operating expenses, but it's not explicitly listed. It does mention dividends paid, which is under the dividends section. There's a total dividends paid figure of $10,817,595.00, so that might be included.

Net income would be net profit, which is $15,804,256.26. Dividends are clearly stated as $10,817,595.00, including both Class "A" and common stock dividends. 

Foreign operations: The report mentions that assets and liabilities in Canada and Cuba are stated on a dollar-for-dollar and dollar-for-peao basis respectively. It also notes that current assets and liabilities of other foreign subsidiaries are included based on exchange rates at the end of the year, while fixed assets use the rates when invested. This indicates how Coca-Cola handled its international operations' financials in 1935.

I should make sure to structure my response with these key points: revenue (if possible), expenses, net income, dividends, and foreign operations. Since revenue isn't directly provided, I might note that it's not explicitly stated but focus on the other figures available.

So, putting this together, my thought process would involve identifying each of these areas in the document, extracting the relevant numbers, and then summarizing them clearly.

Okay, so I'm looking at this user's query, and it seems like they've pasted a financial document related to The Coca-Cola Company from 1936. The document includes balance sheets, income statements, and an audit report from Ernst & Ernst. 

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They didn't explicitly state their question, but since they provided all this financial data, maybe they want help interpreting it or analyzing it. Perhaps they're a student studying accounting, a researcher interested in Coca-Cola's history, or an investor looking into historical financials.

I should start by breaking down the key components of the document. The balance sheet shows assets, liabilities, and equity as of December 31, 1936. I notice that total current assets are around $50 million, with cash at over $28 million. That's a significant portion, which might indicate liquidity or investment opportunities.

Looking at the income statement, they made about $40 million in revenue for the year, with a net profit of almost $3.5 million. The provision for income taxes was around $5 million, but it's interesting that depreciation was expensed and included in manufacturing costs. This tells me something about their accounting methods.

The audit report from Ernst & Ernst is important. It mentions that they didn't do a detailed audit but relied on other independent auditors for foreign subsidiaries. They converted assets using exchange rates at the time, which could affect the financial figures. Their opinion is favorable, stating the statements are fair and prepared correctly.

I also see that dividends were paid out, totaling over $17 million, with some retained earnings contributing to the surplus. This shows how the company was distributing profits versus reinvesting.

Considering the user's perspective, they might be looking for insights into Coca-Cola's financial health in 1936. I should explain these figures in a way that highlights growth areas, profitability, liquidity, and any potential risks or considerations based on the data provided.

I need to make sure my response is clear and covers all the important aspects without assuming too much about their background. Maybe they're looking for a summary of key points rather than a detailed analysis, but I should be prepared to elaborate if needed.

Alright, let's tackle this query where the user is asking me to parse historical Coca-Cola annual report text and extract a true historical anecdote. The instructions specify that I shouldn't summarize performance metrics or include commentary, just one or two sentences if an event is present.

Looking at the provided text, it seems like a list of names followed by locations, possibly executives or agents associated with Coca-Cola. My task is to find any real events here, but all I see are names and places without any context indicating an expansion, packaging change, or other specific events they're interested in.

I need to ensure that I'm not making up anything. Since there's no clear event described, the best response according to the rules is to return 0.

Alright, I'm looking at this query from the user. They provided a block of text that seems to be financial statements and an audit report for The Coca-Cola Company as of December 31, 1937. My first thought is that the user might need help understanding these documents, maybe they're trying to analyze the company's historical performance or something related.

I notice the text includes a balance sheet, income statement, surplus account, and an audit opinion from Ernst & Ernst. There are also sections about dividends paid and some details on foreign subsidiaries. The user included all this information but didn't ask a specific question yet. Maybe they're looking for an explanation of these financials or assistance in interpreting them.

Since the query is just the text without a direct question, I should consider what kind of help would be most useful. Perhaps they want to know how to summarize this data, identify key financial points, or understand the audit opinion. They might also need help with converting old currency values or understanding historical accounting practices.

I should also think about whether there's anything unusual in the documents. The mention of foreign subsidiaries in Canada, Cuba, and others, with different currencies and exchange rates, could be a point of interest. Maybe the user is curious about how these were handled historically versus today.

The user might be a student studying financial statements, an investor looking into historical data, or someone involved in auditing. Understanding their background would help tailor the response better. But since it's not clear, I'll keep my answer general but informative.

I need to make sure I explain any jargon and provide context about what each section means. For example, explaining what a balance sheet and income statement are for those unfamiliar. Also, highlighting key figures like total assets, liabilities, equity, net income, and dividends could be helpful.

The audit report from Ernst & Ernst is important because it gives credibility to the financial statements. I should note that they found everything fairly presented and in line with accounting principles.

I'll structure my response by summarizing each section briefly—balance sheet, income statement, surplus account, and audit opinion—and then offer some key takeaways or insights based on these documents.

Wait, the user didn't specify a particular aspect. Maybe I should ask if they need help with a specific part or provide a general summary instead. But since they included all the text, perhaps a detailed explanation of each component would be best.

I also notice that there are several executives listed at the end; maybe the user is interested in corporate governance back then? Or perhaps not—probably more focused on the financials.

In any case, I'll prepare an organized summary covering each part of the documents and offer to help with any specific questions they might have after reading it.

Alright, I'm looking at this query where the user wants to extract a historical anecdote from Coca-Cola's annual report text. The rules are clear: no summaries of performance or strategy, just real events in one or two sentences.

The text provided is a bit jumbled with names like "G~A~~ANTP TRUST COMPANY OF NEW YORK" and mentions places like New Pork, NY and Wilmington, Delaware. It seems like it's listing companies involved in some transactions.

I need to check if there's any indication of a specific event here. There's no mention of product changes, expansions, ad campaigns, or anything related to Coca-Cola's operations beyond possibly financial dealings with these banks and trust companies. Since the text doesn't describe an actual historical event related to Coke's activities, just some company names, it doesn't fit the criteria.

So, according to the rules, if there's no clear anecdote, I should return 0.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to extract a true historical anecdote from this Coca-Cola annual report text. The user has given specific instructions: they want one or two sentences about an actual event like expansion, recipe change, bottler disputes, etc., and not summaries of profits or strategies.

Looking at the provided text, it's mostly financial statements and mentions of increased production, profits, and employment. There's no mention of any specific events like introducing a new product, expanding to a country, or changes in leadership. The key points are about growth and financial success but without any concrete historical event tied to that.

I need to make sure I'm not summarizing performance metrics; the rules explicitly say not to do that. So even though there's data on earnings and net profits, those don't count as anecdotes. There's no indication of new markets entered, packaging changes, or leadership shifts mentioned in the text.

The user also provided an example where they returned "0" when no event was found. Since this report lacks any specific event beyond financial success, I think returning "0" is appropriate here.

Okay, so I've been given this document about Coca-Cola's financial statements from 1939. It looks like it's pretty detailed and includes balance sheets, profit and loss accounts, and surplus accounts. There are also notes from auditors, Ernst & Ernst, which is interesting because they were a big auditing firm back then.

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. They provided this document but didn't specify exactly what they want. Maybe they're looking for an analysis or summary of these financials? Or perhaps they have some specific questions about them?

Looking at the documents, they mention Class "A" and Common dividends being paid out. The amounts are significant—$1.50 per share for Class "A" in two payments totaling $900k each time, so $1.8 million total. For Common stock, there's a payment on March 31, 1939, of $0.50 per share ($2 million), and then three more payments of $0.75 each ($3 million each), totaling $9 million for those. Then an extra $12 million on December 14, making the total Common dividends $20 million. So overall, they paid out a lot in dividends that year.

The surplus account balance was $33.7 million at the end of 1938 and then increased by net profit of almost $29 million to reach about $62.7 million before dividends. After paying $21.76 million in dividends, the remaining surplus is around $40 million.

The auditors' report says they examined the financials without a full audit but did check enough records and other evidence to be confident. They also mention handling foreign subsidiaries by converting assets at acquisition rates for fixed assets and using year-end rates otherwise. There's some note about removing excess current assets from current liabilities and including it elsewhere, and they feel confident that contingent reserves cover any potential losses.

I think the user might want an analysis of Coca-Cola's financial health in 1939 based on these documents. Maybe they're interested in understanding their profitability, dividend policies, or how they handled international operations given the exchange rate fluctuations.

Alternatively, the user could be looking to extract specific figures or ratios from these statements for a report or presentation. They might also need help understanding some of the accounting methods used, especially regarding foreign subsidiaries and currency exchanges.

Since the documents are quite detailed with footnotes, maybe the user needs an explanation of those notes or how they affect the financials. Or perhaps they're trying to compare this period's performance to later years and want context on historical trends.

I should probably start by summarizing each section—balance sheet, profit and loss, surplus—and then delve into the key points like dividends, net profits, and auditor notes. Highlighting Coca-Cola's growth during the late 1930s could be insightful, especially considering the economic environment post-Depression.

Also, the mention of foreign subsidiaries suggests expansion beyond the U.S., which was probably a strategic move for the company. The handling of different currencies might have posed risks but seems to have been managed with proper reserves as per the auditor's note.

In terms of dividends, paying out a significant portion could indicate confidence in their earnings or a way to return value to shareholders. However, keeping a substantial surplus also shows they're reinvesting for future growth.

I should make sure to explain any jargon or accounting terms that might not be clear to someone without financial background knowledge. Making connections between the figures and the company's strategy could add depth to the analysis.

Overall, I think the user wants a clear, concise summary of these financial statements along with some interpretation of what they mean for Coca-Cola's business performance in 1939.
</think>

The documents you've provided appear to be historical financial records of The Coca-Cola Company from the late 1930s. These include balance sheets, profit and loss accounts, surplus accounts, and an auditor's report. Below is a summary and analysis of the key points:

---

### **Key Highlights from the Financial Statements**

- **Dividends Paid**: $21,800,000.
- **Ending Surplus as of December 31, 1939**: $40,860,000.

---

#### **3. Auditor's Report**
The auditors (Ernst & Ernst) examined the financial statements and found them to be accurate and fairly presented. Key points from their report:
- They verified the accounts without a full audit but considered the evidence sufficient.
- Foreign subsidiaries were handled appropriately, with assets converted at acquisition rates for fixed assets and year-end rates for other balances.
- The company maintained adequate reserves to cover potential contingent losses.

---

### **Analysis**
1. **Dividend Policy**: Coca-Cola paid significant dividends in 1939, indicating strong profitability and a focus on returning value to shareholders. However, the retained earnings ($40,860,000) suggest reinvestment for future growth.
   
2. **Financial Health**: The company's surplus increased despite dividend payments, reflecting robust financial performance. This aligns with Coca-Cola's reputation as a stable and profitable business during this period.

3. **Foreign Expansion**: The mention of foreign subsidiaries indicates that Coca-Cola was expanding internationally by the late 1930s, even though global markets were still recovering from the Great Depression.

4. **Auditor Confidence**: The auditors' report reflects confidence in Coca-Cola's financial management and accounting practices, which is a positive sign for investors.

---

### **Historical Context**
This period (late 1930s) was an important time for Coca-Cola as it transitioned from being a regional drink to a global brand. The company was likely reinvesting profits into production, marketing, and international expansion, setting the stage for its post-World War II growth.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to approach this query where the user wants me to parse a real historical Coca-Cola annual report text and extract a true historical anecdote based on specific rules. The user provided some examples and an evaluation of a given text which returned 0 because no event was found.

First, I need to understand what exactly constitutes a "true historical anecdote" in this context. From the examples, it seems like it's about significant events or changes within Coca-Cola, such as expansion, product changes, leadership shifts, etc. But the user also provided rules: don't summarize performance metrics, avoid market trends, no conclusions, just one or two sentences if a clear event is present, else return 0.

Looking at the example text, it's an excerpt from what appears to be a document listing board members and executives. It has names like R.W. Woodruff, C.B. Candler, W.C. D'Arcy, T.K. Glenn, etc., along with titles and some companies like Guaranty Trust Company of New York, Chase National Bank, Equitable Trust Company.

My task is to read through this text and see if there's any historical event or anecdote. The rules say not to summarize performance, so I'm focusing on events, changes, expansions, etc.

Going through the text:

- It lists the Board of Directors with names and titles.
- There's mention of an Executive Committee with R.W. Woodruff as Chairman, C.B. Candler, W.C. D'Arcy, T.K. Glenn.
- Officers section has several Vice-Presidents, Treasurer, Secretary, etc.
- Legal Counsel is mentioned.
- Transfer Agents: Guaranty Trust Company of New York and Chase National Bank.
- Registrars: Equitable Trust Company in Wilmington, Delaware.

I don't see any indication of an expansion to a new country, changes in recipe or packaging, bottler disputes, wartime production, ad campaigns, leadership changes with impact beyond names, sourcing shifts, etc. It's more about the organizational structure and roles at that time.

No specific event is mentioned here; it's just a list of people and their positions. There's no indication of any significant change or action taken by the company—like introducing a new product, changing strategy, expanding markets, etc.

Therefore, according to the rules, if there's no clear historical event or anecdote present, I should return 0.
